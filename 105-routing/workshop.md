# Workshop for this step

Goals:

* Understand how client side routes are defined in Angular.
* Practice making components and using them.

Add another route to the application:

1. Create a new component, with a simple static template.
2. Add the component to imports in AppModule.
3. Add the route in the route list in app.module.ts.
4. Add a link to the navbar which routes to the new component.
