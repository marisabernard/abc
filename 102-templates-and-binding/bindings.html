<h4>My {{version}} Angular App</h4>

<p>
  Hello, {{person}}
</p>

<p>
  Hello, <span [innerText]="person"></span>
</p>

<h4>Expressions</h4>

<p>3 + 4 = {{ 3 + 4 }}</p>

<p>My mother is {{ personObject.mother + "!!" }}</p>

<p [innerText]="  'My mother is ' + personObject.mother + '!!'  "></p>

<!--
  Function calls in template bindings are best avoided for
  performance reasons. In earlier Angular versions this did not
  work at all with AOT, but it is now tolerated.
-->
<p>Function result is {{ calculate() }}</p>

<!--
  This works in development ("JIT") but generates an error with
  a production ("AOT") build:
-->
<!--
<p>Non-existent property: {{ madeUpPropertyName }}</p>
-->

<h4>Sanitization</h4>

<p>Sanitized by <b>Angular</b>:</p>
<p [innerHtml]="stringWithHtml"></p>

<p>
  If you bind to innerText, the <b>browser</b> does it.
  Note the different output:
</p>
<p [innerText]="stringWithHtml"></p>

<!--
  See the "sanitization" lesson for more information on how
  Angular processes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before they're
  sent to the browser.
